# SimpleLearn - an online Learning Management System

SimpleLearn is an online education platform which was created to ensure online education for students enabling easy access to data for all users. The proposed system should serve as a centralized platform to organize and manage the entire data related to student and faculty information, course enrollments, and announcements along with various user authentications and also by minimizing data anomalies by the users. The system also manages Admins who control everything concerning the students, faculty, courses and registrations. Admins will have all the functionalities like adding new students, instructors and courses. They can add or remove a particular student from a particular course and delete a course from the curriculum of that year.
Students can log in to their dashboard, register and view their courses, write quizzes, and view their grades in their dashboard. Instructors can add new courses they want to teach and add or remove students from their courses. They can create quizzes and grade the assignments and quizzes submitted by the students.

To sum up, the suggested E-Learning Management System (ELMS) offers educational institutions a comprehensive and revolutionary way to manage every facet of the learning process efficiently. A smooth and engaging learning experience for students is made possible by the system's robust design and seamless integration with various components, which also empowers faculty members to complete their tasks quickly. By extending their reach beyond the confines of the traditional classroom, educational institutions will be able to foster a dynamic and collaborative learning environment through implementation of SimpleLearn. To accommodate their various learning preferences and styles, students will have the freedom to access course materials, take part in interactive activities, and monitor their progress at their own pace.
